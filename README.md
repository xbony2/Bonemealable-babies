# Bonemealable-babies
This handy-dandy mod allows the player to use Bone Meal on baby animals! Three Bone Meal max will grow that baby to a full adult (although 1-2 will work when the baby's been the world long enough). Works on Cows, Chickens, Villagers, etc (any entity that extends EntityAgeable).

The official downloads (CurseForge) are [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bonemealable-babies).
